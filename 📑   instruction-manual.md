### 📈 **Experience Level Assessment**

| Experience Level | Characteristics | Recommended Approach |
|------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **🌱 New to Co-Design** | First time working directly with users; focused on learning the basics | Start with beginner tools, plan extra time, consider training |
| **📈 Some Experience** | Have done user research or stakeholder engagement before; comfortable with collaboration | Use intermediate tools, focus on systematic approach |
| **🎯 Advanced Practitioner** | Experienced with user-centered methods; ready for complex facilitation | Leverage advanced tools, consider mentoring others |

## 🛠️ Step 2: Select and Prepare Your Tools

### 🎯 **Tool Selection Strategy**

<details>
<summary><strong>Option A: Follow the Sequential Path</strong></summary>

**Best for**: Teams new to co-design who want a structured approach

**Discovery → Co-Creation → Development → Deployment**

1. Start with [Stakeholder Mapping](https://github.com/your-repo/issues/1)
2. Conduct [Discovery Interviews](https://github.com/your-repo/issues/2) 
3. Run [Co-Design Workshops](https://github.com/your-repo/issues/6)
4. Implement [User Testing](https://github.com/your-repo/issues/11)
5. Plan [Soft Launch](https://github.com/your-repo/issues/16)

**Pros**: Comprehensive, builds expertise gradually, thorough user understanding
**Cons**: Time-intensive, requires significant commitment

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Option B: Target Specific Needs</strong></summary>

**Best for**: Teams with experience who need to address specific challenges

**Pick tools based on your current pain points:**
- 🚧 **Poor user adoption?** → [User Testing Protocol](https://github.com/your-repo/issues/11)
- 🤔 **Unclear requirements?** → [Requirements Definition Canvas](https://github.com/your-repo/issues/7)
- 👥 **Don't know your users?** → [Stakeholder Mapping Workshop](https://github.com/your-repo/issues/1)
- 🔄 **Solution doesn't fit workflows?** → [User Journey Mapping Kit](https://github.com/your-repo/issues/8)

**Pros**: Efficient, addresses immediate needs, flexible timing
**Cons**: May miss broader context, requires good self-assessment

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Option C: Iterative Integration</strong></summary>

**Best for**: Teams mid-development who want to add co-design practices

**Integrate tools into existing workflows:**
1. **Week 1**: Add [Prototype Review Sessions](https://github.com/your-repo/issues/12) to development sprints
2. **Week 3**: Conduct [Output Validation](https://github.com/your-repo/issues/9) with key stakeholders
3. **Week 6**: Run [User Testing](https://github.com/your-repo/issues/11) on current prototypes
4. **Ongoing**: Use [Decision Documentation](https://github.com/your-repo/issues/22) for all changes

**Pros**: Low disruption, builds habits, immediate benefits
**Cons**: Less comprehensive, requires discipline to maintain

</details>

### 📋 **Tool Preparation Checklist**

**For Each Tool You Select:**
- [ ] Read the full tool instructions (linked in Issues)
- [ ] Identify required participants and their roles
- [ ] Schedule necessary meetings/workshops
- [ ] Prepare required materials (templates, surveys, etc.)
- [ ] Set up documentation system for outputs
- [ ] Plan follow-up activities and next steps

## 👥 Step 3: Engage Your Stakeholders

### 🎯 **Stakeholder Engagement Strategy**

<details>
<summary><strong>🤝 Building Successful Partnerships</strong></summary>

**Key Principles** *(Source: NSITE Solution Project Requirements and Expectations)*:
- **Transparency**: Be clear about time commitments and expectations
- **Reciprocity**: Show how their input shapes the solution
- **Respect**: Value their expertise in their own workflows
- **Consistency**: Maintain regular communication and follow-through

**Initial Engagement Approach:**
1. **Explain the "why"**: Share the benefits of co-design
2. **Be realistic**: Honest about time commitments and process
3. **Start small**: Begin with low-commitment activities
4. **Show value quickly**: Demonstrate immediate benefits from their input

</details>

### 📅 **Touchpoint Planning**

<details>
<summary><strong>📊 NASA NSITE Touchpoint Framework</strong></summary>

**Based on**: *NSITE SEP and Co-Design Plan, Vision, Structure*

**Minimum Viable Touchpoints:**
1. **🎯 Project Kickoff** - Introduce co-design approach, set expectations
2. **📋 Requirements Review** - Validate user needs and solution parameters
3. **🧪 Mid-Development Check** - Test prototypes, gather feedback
4. **🚀 Pre-Launch Review** - Final validation before broader release

**Enhanced Touchpoints** (if time/resources allow):
- **🔍 Discovery workshops** - Deep-dive into user contexts
- **🎨 Co-design sessions** - Collaborative solution development
- **⚙️ Iterative testing** - Regular prototype feedback
- **🌱 Sustainability planning** - Long-term ownership discussions

</details>
📑
### 📞 **Communication Best Practices**

| 📋 **Do** | ❌ **Don't** |
|----------|-------------|
| Set clear agendas for all meetings | Wing it or assume people know why they're there |
| Send materials in advance when possible | Surprise people with complex exercises |
| Follow up with summaries and next steps | Leave people wondering what happens next |
| Show how feedback was used | Collect input but not show its impact |
| Respect time commitments | Run over scheduled time regularly |
