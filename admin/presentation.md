<summary><h3>🛠️ Find-a-Tool Feature - The Navigation Secret Weapon</h3></summary>

**The Problem:** 38+ tools can be overwhelming. How do you find the right one?

**The Solution:** Multi-filter navigation system

```
🎯 User Input:
├─ "Where am I?" → Discovery phase
├─ "What do I need?" → Stakeholder engagement
├─ "Who am I?" → 3-person team, 4 hours available, intermediate
└─ Results: 3-5 perfectly matched tools

✅ User gets started immediately
✅ No decision paralysis
✅ Confidence they're using the right approach
```

**💡 Innovation:** Not browse-and-guess. Not overwhelming lists. **Contextual matching.**
