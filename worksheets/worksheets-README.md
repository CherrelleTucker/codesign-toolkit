## 🔄 How Worksheets Are Created

**Completely Automatic** - You don't need to do anything!

1. **When a tool issue is created or edited**, a GitHub Action automatically triggers
2. **The workflow extracts** all issue content and metadata
3. **All collapsible sections are expanded** so nothing is hidden in the PDF
4. **A PDF is generated** and saved here as `issue-<number>.pdf`
5. **A download link is posted** as a comment on the issue

**This means:**
- ✅ Worksheets are always **up-to-date** with the latest tool content
- ✅ You **never need to manually create** worksheets
- ✅ Every tool automatically has a **printable version**

## 📂 Worksheet Naming Convention

Worksheets are named by their issue number:

```
issue-5.pdf  → Worksheet for Issue #5
issue-12.pdf → Worksheet for Issue #12
issue-39.pdf → Worksheet for Issue #39
```

**To find which tool a worksheet belongs to:**
1. Note the issue number (e.g., `issue-39.pdf` = Issue #39)
2. Go to: `https://github.com/[your-repo]/issues/39`
3. Or browse all tools: [View All Tools](../../../issues?q=is:issue+label:tool)

## 🌟 Making the Most of Worksheets

Remember: **These worksheets are tools to support your co-design practice**, not rigid scripts to follow blindly.

### **✅ Do:**
- Adapt tools to your specific context

- Use worksheets as conversation starters
- Document your learnings and adaptations
- Share successful approaches with the community

### **❌ Don't:**
- Follow worksheets without understanding the principles
- Skip stakeholder engagement because you have a worksheet
- Treat worksheets as the final word (they're living documents)
- Forget to close the feedback loop with your users
