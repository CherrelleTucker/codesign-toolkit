<summary><strong>📋 Workflow Discovery & Integration Analysis Activity</strong></summary>

## Activity Overview
**Duration:** 2-3 hours per session  
**Participants:** 3-6 end users per session  
**Format:** Interactive workshop with multiple discovery techniques

## Pre-Activity Setup
- **Stakeholder Mapping:** Identify primary, secondary, and peripheral users
- **Context Gathering:** Understand current pain points and desired outcomes
- **Material Prep:** Large format paper, sticky notes, markers, digital collaboration tools

### Journey Mapping Exercise
**Technique:** End-to-end process visualization

**Instructions:**
1. **Trigger Identification** (10 min)
   - "What starts this process for you?"
   - "How do you know it's time to begin?"
   - Map all possible entry points

2. **Step-by-Step Walkthrough** (25 min)
   - Use sticky notes for each action
   - Include decision points, handoffs, delays
   - Capture tools, systems, and people involved
   - **Key Questions:**
     - "What happens next?"
     - "Who else is involved at this point?"
     - "What could go wrong here?"
     - "How long does this typically take?"

3. **Parallel Process Discovery** (10 min)
   - "What else are you doing while this happens?"
   - "What other processes intersect with this one?"

### "Day in the Life" Shadowing Simulation
**Technique:** Detailed walkthrough with probing questions

**Activities:**

1. **The "Obvious" Challenge** (15 min)
   - Ask users to explain their process to a "new hire"
   - Record everything they assume is "obvious"
   - **Probe:** "How did you learn that?" "Is that written down anywhere?"

2. **Exception Scenarios** (15 min)
   - "What happens when [system] is down?"
   - "How do you handle rush jobs?"
   - "What's your workaround when [X] doesn't work?"

3. **Muscle Memory Mapping** (10 min)
   - Watch users demonstrate physical/digital actions
   - **Ask:** "Why do you do it that way?"
   - "What would happen if you couldn't do that step?"

### Tribal Knowledge Indicators Checklist
- [ ] Processes learned through observation only
- [ ] Unwritten quality checks
- [ ] Personal shortcuts and hacks
- [ ] Relationship-dependent handoffs
- [ ] Historical context ("We do this because...")

### Replacement Feasibility Assessment

**Method:** Color-coded workflow analysis

**Categories:**
- 🟢 **Easily Replaceable:** Routine, digital, rules-based tasks
- 🟡 **Partially Replaceable:** Tasks requiring human judgment or creativity
- 🔴 **Non-Replaceable:** Critical human skills, regulatory requirements, relationship-dependent
- 🟣 **Unknown/Hybrid:** Requires deeper investigation

### Integration Opportunity Mapping (20 min)
1. **Direct Replacement Points**
   - Which steps could your solution completely handle?
   - What data/inputs would it need?

2. **Enhancement Opportunities**
   - Where could your solution augment human capability?
   - What information could it provide to improve decisions?

3. **Handoff Points**
   - Where does your solution need to interface with existing systems?
   - What triggers would start/stop your solution's involvement?

### Barrier Identification Exercise (15 min)
**"Red Flag" Analysis:**
- Regulatory/compliance requirements
- Union or policy constraints
- Cultural resistance points
- Technical limitations
- Training/adoption challenges

### Impact vs. Effort Matrix
Plot each integration opportunity on:
- **X-axis:** Implementation difficulty (including tribal knowledge barriers)
- **Y-axis:** Business impact/value

### Stakeholder Buy-in Assessment
**Questions for each integration point:**
1. "How would this change affect your daily work?"
2. "What concerns do you have about this approach?"
3. "What would make this transition successful?"
4. "Who else would need to be involved in this change?"

## 🔧 Facilitation Tips

**For Uncovering Tribal Knowledge:**
- Use open-ended questions: "Tell me more about..."
- Look for hesitations or "well, usually..." statements
- Ask about exceptions and edge cases
- Probe assumptions: "Why is that important?"

**For Resistance Management:**
- Acknowledge expertise and experience
- Focus on enhancement rather than replacement
- Address concerns directly and honestly
- Involve users in solution design decisions
