### 🎯 **Definition from NASA's NSITE Program**

> *"User-Centered Design (UCD) is a collaborative approach to product and solution development in which the developer works together with the end user to formulate solutions and implementation plans. Co-design fosters an environment in which agencies can participate in the solution space, providing insight into workflows and the decision-making process to the implementation teams during stakeholder or user 'touch points.' The co-design process ensures that solutions will be usable, accessible, and actionable upon completion."*

### 🎯 **Key Insight**
This isn't a linear process! You'll cycle through these stages multiple times, refining and improving your solution based on continuous user engagement and feedback.

**Each cycle teaches you:**
- What users actually need (vs. what you thought)
- How they really work (vs. how you assumed)
- What barriers exist (that you didn't know about)
- Which solutions stick (and which don't)

## 🌟 Six Core Principles

<details>
<summary><strong>🎯 1. User Focus: Design WITH Users, Not FOR Them</strong></summary>

### What This Means:
- Users are partners, not recipients
- Their expertise in their own workflows is invaluable
- Engagement happens throughout development, not just at the end

### In Practice:
- Start conversations before you start coding
- Regular check-ins during development
- Users help define success criteria

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔄 2. Iterative Design: Build, Test, Learn, Refine</strong></summary>

### What This Means:
- Small improvements based on real feedback
- Fail fast, learn quickly
- Each iteration is informed by user input

### In Practice:
- Weekly user feedback sessions
- Rapid prototyping and testing
- Documentation of what works (and what doesn't)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🌍 3. Context Awareness: Understand the Real World</strong></summary>

### What This Means:
- Technical constraints are just one part of the puzzle
- Institutional, cultural, and workflow contexts matter
- Solutions must fit actual deployment environments

### In Practice:
- Observe users in their actual work settings
- Map information flows and decision-making processes
- Account for organizational constraints and timelines

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>✨ 4. Usability First: Make It Work for Real People</strong></summary>

### What This Means:
- Technical functionality ≠ usability
- Accessibility is non-negotiable
- Solutions should feel intuitive, not complicated

### In Practice:
- User testing with actual tasks
- Accessibility reviews and improvements
- Training materials that match user skill levels

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🤝 5. Collaborative Planning: Foster Shared Investment</strong></summary>

### What This Means:
- Transparent communication builds trust
- Joint decision-making creates ownership
- Success is measured collectively

### In Practice:
- Shared project roadmaps and timelines
- Regular touchpoints with clear agendas
- Documentation of decisions and rationale

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>📊 6. Evidence-Based: Ground Decisions in Data</strong></summary>

### What This Means:
- User research trumps assumptions
- Validated feedback drives design choices
- Success is measured and documented

### In Practice:
- Structured needs assessments
- Usability testing with metrics
- Impact stories and adoption tracking
